# Music Releases
This project was created during the Technigo bootcamp. The asignment was to create a music releases site using React components. The project was developed by pair-programming.

## The problem
We structured the project by building several components and mounted them all together in App.js. 
We used the .map() method to iterate over the music album array and used keys and props to connect them to the components.
All the styling and hover effects were created with CSS.
If we had more time we would have implemented the JavaScript solution to add comma and & between the artists.
